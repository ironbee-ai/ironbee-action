// Whether the run passes.
//
// The most consequential decision this action makes, and until now the only one
// still written in YAML-embedded shell — where it could not be tested, and where
// it was wrong: the platform branch exited the verification command's status and
// nothing else. A run whose command exited 0 without creating a job therefore
// passed. That happened. Nothing was verified, the report said so, and the gate
// was green.
//
// The rule both modes now share: a verdict is required. An exit status describes
// whether a command ran, not whether an application works, and "did not fail" is
// not the same as "passed" — the gap between them is exactly an unverified
// change being merged.
